I am a columbia student of Public Health Data Science track in [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/).  My expected graduation date is in May 2023. I want to be a software engineer or a data scientist after graduation.

The road is rough and long, the world is creazy and mad. 
I am calm like never stirred water
