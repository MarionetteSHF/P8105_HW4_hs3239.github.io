### Problem 2

Create a flexdashboard using plotly for that includes at least three distinct plot types (e.g. scatterplots, line plots, bar plots, box plots, etc.).

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
library(plotly)
```

```{r data_selection}
data("rest_inspec")

rest_inspec =
  rest_inspec %>%
  mutate(boro = str_to_title(boro)) %>% 
  filter(grade %in% c("A", "B", "C"), boro == "Manhattan") %>%
  relocate(boro) %>% 
  sample_n(10000) %>% 
  view
```
